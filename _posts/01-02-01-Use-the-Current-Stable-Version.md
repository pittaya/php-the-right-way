## Use the Current Stable Version (5.5) {#use_the_current_stable_version_55_title}

If you are just getting started with PHP make sure to start with the current stable release of [PHP 5.5][php-release]. PHP has made great strides adding powerful [new features](#language_highlights) over the last few years. Don't let the minor version number difference between 5.2 and 5.5 fool you, it represents _major_ improvements. If you are looking for a function or its usage, the documentation on the [php.net][php-docs] website will have the answer.
