## Errors {#errors_title}

PHP has several levels of error severity. The three most common types of messages are errors, notices and warnings. These have different levels of severity; `E_ERROR`, `E_NOTICE`, and `E_WARNING`. Errors are fatal run-time errors and are usually caused by faults in your code and need to be fixed as they'll cause PHP to stop executing. Warnings are non-fatal errors, execution of the script will not be halted. Notices are advisory messages caused by code that may or may not cause problems during the execution of the script, execution is not halted. 

Another type of error message reported at compile time is the `E_STRICT` message, these messages are used to suggest changes to your code to help ensure best interoperability and forward compatibility for your code.
