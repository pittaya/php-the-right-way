We'll link to your translation from the primary document.\r\n\r\nTo avoid fragmentation and reader confusion, please choose one of these options:\r\n\r\n1. We link to your GitHub Pages fork with `[username].github.com/php-the-right-way`\r\n2. We link to your GitHub Pages fork with a subdomain (e.g. \"ru.phptherightway.com\")\r\n\r\nIf you use a subdomain, enter the subdomain into the `CNAME` file, and ask us to setup DNS for you. If you do not use a subdomain, remove the `CNAME` file entirely else your fork will not build when pushed.\r\n\r\nWhen your translation is ready, open an issue on the Issue Tracker to let us know.\r\n\r\n## Why\r\n\r\nThere's been a lot of discussion lately about how the PHP community lacks sufficient, credible information for programmers new to PHP. This repository aims to solve this problem.\r\n\r\n## Who\r\n\r\nMy name is [Josh Lockhart](http://twitter.com/codeguy). I'm the author of the [Slim Framework](http://www.slimframework.com/), and I work for [New Media Campaigns](http://www.newmediacampaigns.com/).\r\n\r\n### Collaborators\r\n\r\n* [Kris Jordan](http://krisjordan.com/)\r\n* [Phil Sturgeon](http://philsturgeon.co.uk/)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n[Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
